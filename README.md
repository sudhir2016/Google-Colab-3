# Google-Colab-3
VGG16
is a simple example of applying VGG16 model to classify an image, using TensorFlow and Keras in Google Colaboratory Notebook. The steps are as follows.

- Load TensorFlow, Keras, VGG16  and Python libraries.
- Set the VGG16 model and print model summary.
- Load an image from the net.
- Process the image data and prepare it for VGG16 model.
- Apply image data to VGG16 model and obtain output of model.
- Interpret the output of model and print the result.
